# Google Maps Shortest Path Finder and Visualizer

This project was inspired by my desire to learn different path finding algorithms. I was really interested and drawn by the enormous applications of path finding algorithms and the different varieties of these types of algorithms. I got introduced to Breadth First Search and Depth First Search in my data structres and algorithms classes and I really wanted to learn more. 

## Introduction/Inspiration

This project was inspired by my desire to learn an application of path finding algorithms in Navigation through actual application. I grew up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in the subcity Gerji. Growing up, I realized that people go around to places using landmarks and nobody really uses nagivation or GPS on their map. This is in stark contrast to how people move around in New York City or any developed country. There are a variety of reasons for why this is. First, **Internet in Ethiopia** is very expensive and most people can't afford to use their data on navigation. Second, the general population ***don't really have advanced smart phones*** as compared to US or Western Countires. And finally, the navigation apps such as Google Maps don't really give the shortest path as they rely mostly on roads and there are a majority of roads in Ethiopia that aren't recongized as roads and there are alot of shortcuts people use that don't appear on Google Maps.

## Technologies/Stack

This project uses Python Django Framework for the backend. For the front end, I used Javascript, HTML and CSS. Soon enough, I will use ReactJS for the front end.

## PATH-FINDING 

Pathfinding algorithms are usually an attempt to solve the shortest path problem in graph theory. They try to find the best path given a starting point and ending point based on some predefined criteria.

In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.”
