# Google Maps Shortest Path Finder and Visualizer

This project was inspired by my desire to learn different path finding algorithms. I was really interested and drawn by the enormous applications of path finding algorithms and the different varieties of these types of algorithms. I got introduced to Breadth First Search and Depth First Search in my data structres and algorithms classes and I really wanted to learn more. 

##### This project was inspired by my desire to learn an application of path finding (Navigation) through actual application. I grew up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in the subcity Gerji. Growing up, I realized that people go around to places using landmarks and nobody really uses nagivation or GPS on their map. This is in stark contrast to how people move around in New York City or any developed country. There are a variety of reasons for why this is. First, **Internet in Ethiopia** is very expensive and most people can't afford to use their data on navigation. Second, the general population don't really have advanced smart phones as compared to US or Western Countires.
